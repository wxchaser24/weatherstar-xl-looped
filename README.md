Are you a developer? Pull requests are welcome! If you find a bug and fix it yourself, submit one with the fixed code and it may be merged into the main branch!

# Initial Setup

1. Install [node.js LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/).
2. Acquire a *mapbox.com* API key. This is required for the radar to operate.
3. Go to `/webroot/js` and open `config.js`.
5. Line 2 is where your *mapbox.com*  API key goes. Replace `"YOUR_API_KEY"` with your *mapbox.com* API key.
6. Save your changes to `config.js` and close out of it.
7. Run `install.bat` *(`install.sh` on macOS)*. This will install all dependencies required to run.
8. Run `start.bat` *(`start.sh` on macOS)*. This will start a local web server, which is required to run the sim.

You're all set. Enjoy!

Many thanks for using our simulator! We hope you like it.
